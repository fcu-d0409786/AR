# ARKit demo for horizontal planes detection

Augmented reality has the power to amplify the world in ways never possible before. The way in which we interact with our world may never be the same again. With the release of iPhone X, the world is ready to embrace AR now more than ever before. We are at a special time in history and just at the beginning of something huge. The potential of AR is endless.

In this tutorial, our focus is on horizontal plane in ARKit. We are going to first create an ocean (horizontal plane). Then place a nice ship on top (3D object).
